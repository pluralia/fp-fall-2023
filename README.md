# Haskell Fall 2023

Haskell course homework

### How to pass the course

- homework
    - after each lecture
    - write tests! no tests -- your grade goes down
    - use `hlint` and `-Wall``
    - deadline: Thursday 23:59
    - 1 time per semester you can pass homework after the deadline (no more than 1 week later) and get a full grade
- exam
    - theory + practice
- [grade for the course] = [average homework grade] * 0.5 + [exam] * 0.5
