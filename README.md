# Haskell Fall 2023

Haskell course homework

## How to pass the course

- homework
    - after each lecture | **10 points max**
    - deadline: Thursday 23:59 | **0 points per task after the deadline**
    - 1 week to fix my comments | **all comments fixed -> full grade**.
    - write tests | **no tests -> your grade goes down**
    - project can be built and tests work | **build/tests fail to my review -> -2 points**
        - write me before opening PR if you can't solve the problem
    - use `hlint` and `-Wall` | **not explained compiler warnings and hlint recommendations -> -1 point**
    - do not pass solutions to each other | **explicit reuse -> 0 points per task**
        - write me before opening PR if you struggle with the task and want to get a hint
    - Once a semester, you may pass homework after the deadline (no more than 1 week later) and get a full grade
- exam
    - theory + practice
- [grade for the course] = [average homework grade] * 0.5 + [exam] * 0.5

### How to pass your homework

1. Fork this repo -- each branch contains the homework for the corresponding lecture
2. Create a branch `hw<x>` and your project directory `hw<x>`, where ```x `elem` [1..12]```
3. As you complete the assignment
   - check you have no compiler warnings and all tests pass: `cabal clean && cabal test`
   - all hlint hints are fixed: `hlint .`
   - open the PR in this repo
   - the PR should be named: <HW###>, <LastName_FirstName>
4. I review your PR and leave my comments: accepted or requires fixes

### Basics I

- Terms & their properties
    - associativity
    - binding order is unimportant
    - immutability
    - lazy by default
- Binding
    - global & local
    - `let`, `where`
- Functions (+ lambdas)
- Pattern-matching (+ `case of`)
- Branching
    - `if-then-else`
    - guards
- Operators
- Currying
- Recursion & Tail recursion
- Types
    - Base types (`Bool`, `Char`, `Int`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Double`, `T1 -> T2`, `(T1, T2, ..., Tn)`, `()`, `[T]`)
    - Type constraints
    - Custom types
    - Standard module types (`Maybe`, `Either`, list, tuple)
