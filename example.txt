After the release of Miranda by Research Software Ltd. in 1985, interest in
lazy functional languages grew. By 1987, more than a dozen non-strict, purely
functional programming languages existed. Miranda was the most widely used, but
it was proprietary software. At the conference on Functional Programming

Languages and Computer Architecture (FPCA '87) in Portland, Oregon, there was a
strong consensus that a committee be formed to define an open standard for such
languages. The committee's purpose was to consolidate existing functional
languages into a common one to serve as a basis for future research in
functional-language design.
